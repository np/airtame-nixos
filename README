# How to update to a different version

Pick your channel (ga, beta, alpha)

$ CHANNEL=ga

Head over https://downloads.airtame.com/application/$CHANNEL/lin_x64/releases/deb/
and set the version number you want:

$ VERSION=2.0.3

Download the .deb package using:

$ nix-prefetch-url https://downloads.airtame.com/application/$CHANNEL/lin_x64/releases/deb/airtame-application_${VERSION}_amd64.deb

Get the generated hash and edit airtame-nw.nix version numbers and hash in the "src = {...}" block.
Now you can build the nix package:

$ nix-build

You can then run the freshly built version:

$ ./result/bin/launch-airtame

Or install it:

$ nix-env -f . -i
